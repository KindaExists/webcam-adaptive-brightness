This repository contains the main project files used for the implementation of the research entitled: **"Development of a Webcam-based Adjustable Adaptive Brightness Program for Minimizing Eye Strain from Laptop Screens. "**

This project was developed for the accomplishment of the Research 3 subject of Philippine Science Highschool - Main Campus.

## Abstract

With the recent shift of many institutions towards digital work, digital eye strain is becoming a more widespread problem. Computer vision syndrome (CVS) or digital eye strain describes a set of eye-related problems caused by prolonged or excessive focus on a digital screen. Risks of these conditions are further exacerbated when the lighting of a userâ€™s screen does not match the lighting of their surroundings. To alleviate this, various adaptive-brightness applications have been developed for computer devices. However, these are often limited by their light sensor requirement and lack of adjustability. Thus, this study aimed to develop a program for minimizing eye strain from laptop screens by adjusting the screen brightness of the computer in accordance with the light detected through a webcam and a user-defined linear relation curve. This program was developed for Windows 10 laptops using Python with the OpenCV, WMI, and Tkinter libraries.
