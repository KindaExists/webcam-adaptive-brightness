# Week 5 Implementation

* Very little progress this week due to focus on other requirements of Res3
* Added early files
* Installed some modules
  * opencv-python
  * webcam-brightness-control

* While progress is sparse this week, work done this week and next week will act as foundation for later weeks
* No advanced user-interface libraries have been added yet (eg. pyside2, pyQT5, etc.)
  * These will be added to the project later
  * These modules are especially difficult to procure due to installation-related issues
